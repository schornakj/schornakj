### Projects Worth Highlighting:

#### Truncated Signed Distance Fields

[`yak`](https://github.com/ros-industrial/yak) - Core libraries for KinectFusion-style CUDA-accelerated surface reconstruction using RGB-D images and point clouds.

[`yak_ros`](https://github.com/ros-industrial/yak_ros) - ROS C++ nodes and messages wrapping Yak

[`yak_ros2`](https://github.com/ros-industrial/yak_ros2) ✨ROS2✨ C++ nodes and messages wrapping Yak.

#### Camera Calibration

[`robot_cal_tools`](https://github.com/Jmeyer1292/robot_cal_tools) - Libraries that use 2D and 3D data to perform intrinsic, extrinsic, and kinematic calibration of cameras and robots.

[`mutable_transform_publisher`](https://github.com/schornakj/mutable_transform_publisher/tree/feature/ros2) - ROS2 package for persistantly publishing a transform using a locally-saved YAML config file.
